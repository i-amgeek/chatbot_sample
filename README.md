## Inspiration
With the increasing population in India, demand for doctors has also exploded. WHO suggeets having 1:1000 ratio of doctors but according to some studies India lacks 500,000 doctors to meet that criteria. Although there are cures available for diseases online but lots of them are false which can cause more harm than cure.

## Idea
We will build a chatbot that can be trusted and provides cures provided by registered doctors. It can be also be very helpful in emergency situations where patients requires immediate solution until he reaches doctors as in case of accident. This can save many lives.

## Implementation
* Data will be collected from online healthcare platforms which helps in connecting doctors with patients.
* This data will be reverified by registered healthcare practitioners.
* After verification, data will be feeded to chatbot for training.
* Chatbot goes through testing to ensure it is not proving any false information to patients.
* Only then, chatbot will be made for public use.
